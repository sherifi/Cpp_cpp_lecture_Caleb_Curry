//intro to constructors
//constructor is class method that is created implicitly where we create object form class
//form is exm: User(){code};
//constructor usualy have the same name as class and take no arguments
//in class we can also create explicitly constructor that can be changed 
//and behave as we like and can accept other arguments
//form is exm: User( std::string fname, std::string lname ){code};
//after we create constructors explicitly there are no implicitly created constructor
//at the end of object is also one class method that is creatd implicitly destructor
//for is exm: ~User(){code};
//destructor have the job to destory the object after the runin that object
//also we can create desturctor in explicitly way
